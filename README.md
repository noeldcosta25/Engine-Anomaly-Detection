# Engine Fault Detection using Machine Learning

This project simulates real-world vehicle engine sensor data and detects abnormal engine behavior using Machine Learning anomaly detection.

## Problem Statement

Modern vehicles generate large volumes of sensor data (RPM, temperature, vibration, oil pressure). Detecting abnormal patterns early helps prevent engine failure and supports predictive maintenance.

## Approach

- Synthetic engine dataset generation
- Data cleaning & validation
- Feature scaling
- Isolation Forest anomaly detection
- Visualization of abnormal engine behavior

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

## Output

The model automatically detects abnormal engine operating conditions from sensor signals.

## Application

Predictive maintenance in automotive diagnostics systems.
